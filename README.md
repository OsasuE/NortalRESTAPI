# NortalRESTAPI
This is the home assignment for Nortal for their Junior Software Engineer Trainee program for Summer 2022.

The task is to design, implement and document a REST API that uses a relational database as a
repository.

I created a PostgreSQL database by installing PostgreSQL, creating a new user, creating a database, and initializing a table 
with schema and some data.

After creating the database I was able to begin building the Node.js RESTful API to connect to this data stored in a 
PostgreSQL database.
